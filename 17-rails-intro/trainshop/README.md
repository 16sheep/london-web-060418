# Rails

What's different?

- Making a model
the old way: 3 steps
the new way: `rails g model ????`

- Routing
the old way: route in your controller
the new way: `routes.rb`

- View naming
the old way: `*.erb`
the new way: `*.html.erb`

- Links on pages
the old way: annoying <a> tags
the new way: `link_to`

- Path helpers
the old way: there are none
the new way: `rails/rake routes`
